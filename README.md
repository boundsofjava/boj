# The Bounds of Java website

This is the website of The Bounds of Java, home of The Bounds of Java Newsletter, in which (like it's told in the main page itself) Java's edge concepts and advanced tricks are introduced and explored in depth. Software architecture and patterns, object-oriented design principles and functional programming techniques are covered and analyzed in a way that (I hope) is both innovative and enjoyable.

The Bounds of Java website also introduces The Bounds of Java Blog, where I plan to write articles about software, technology and science from a more personal and subjective point of view.
