    "summary": "A <em>higher-order function</em> is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments and that might return a function as its result. Here we take an informal approach to higher-order functions by showing how to apply this functional programming concept to <span class='code'>Runnable</span> instances."

    "summary": "Java lacks a built-in way to define default arguments for methods and constructors. Over the years, several approaches have been proposed, each with its pros and cons. The most widely-known one uses <em>method overloading</em>, though varargs, null values, the builder pattern and even maps have been used as well. Here we propose a new approach based on functional constructs."

    "summary": "In this issue of The Bounds of Java Newsletter, we present four basic functional constructs that every developer should be aware of. We also introduce the concept of <em>monad</em>, which is very important to write useful functional code, but we carefully avoid digging into the intricacies of category theory."
