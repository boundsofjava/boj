<p>Welcome to my very first newsletter, completely devised and written in the distant Uruguay, where the southern wind hits the land and makes every soul feel that winter is about to come, despite it's still autumn.</p>

<p>Winter isn't very impressive here. It never snows and cold is quite bearable, compared to other latitudes. Actually, there's nothing remarkable about weather in Uruguay. However, Uruguayans love to talk about it. Every year, when it starts getting cold in May, we say that it either has begun earlier than in previous years, or that it's going to be more intense than ever. I'm pretty confident that there's no spot on Earth where people talk about the weather more than here. This is especially true when people are invited to someone's house and it's time to leave. It is a well-known fact that in some countries people leave without saying goodbye, whereas here in Uruguay people say goodbye without leaving, because they're precisely talking about the weather...</p>
