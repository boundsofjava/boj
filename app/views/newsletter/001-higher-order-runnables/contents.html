<h3><em>Background</em></h3>

<p>In Java 8, a block of code that takes no arguments and has no returning value can be assigned to a <span class="code"><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Runnable.html" target="_blank">Runnable</a></span> instance straightforwardly:</p>

<div hljs hljs-no-escape hljs-language="java">
Runnable blockOfCode = () -> {
    System.out.println("Q: What was the weather like in winter of 2015?");
    System.out.println("A: It was very cold");
};
</div>

<p>Then, later in our program, we could execute this block of code by invoking the <span class="code">run()</span> method of our <span class="code">Runnable</span> instance:</p>

<div hljs hljs-no-escape hljs-language="java">
blockOfCode.run();
</div>

<p>Now, let's suppose the code resides in the <span class="code">whatWasTheWeatherLike()</span> method of the <span class="code">Winter</span> class:</p>

<div hljs hljs-no-escape hljs-language="java">
public class Winter {

    private final int year;

    public Winter(int year) {
        this.year = year;
    }

    public void whatWasTheWeatherLike() {
        System.out.printf("Q: What was the weather like in winter of %d?%n", year);
        System.out.println("A: It was very cold");
    }
}
</div>

<p>In this case, instead of using a lambda expression with an inline block of code, we could use a <em>reference to an instance method</em> of the <span class="code">Winter</span> class:</p>

<div hljs hljs-no-escape hljs-language="java">
Winter winterOf2015 = new Winter(2015);
Runnable runnable = winterOf2015::whatWasTheWeatherLike;
</div>

<p>So far so good. But, what if we wanted to assign different blocks of code to different <span class="code">Runnable</span> instances? We might want to keep references not only to the <span class="code">whatWasTheWeatherLike()</span> instance method of the <span class="code">winterOf2015</span> instance, but also to any no-arguments, <span class="code">void</span> method of any class, as well as to any inline block of code:

<div hljs hljs-no-escape hljs-language="java">
List<Runnable> runnables = new ArrayList<>();

Winter winterOf2015 = new Winter(2015);
runnables.add(winterOf2015::whatWasTheWeatherLike);

Winter winterOf2012 = new Winter(2012);
runnables.add(winterOf2012::whatWasTheWeatherLike);

runnables.add(() -> {
    System.out.println("Inline block of code");
});

// will print a blank line when executed
runnables.add(System.out::println);

// will invoke someNoArgsVoidMethod method on
// someClassInstance instance when executed
SomeClass someClassInstance = new SomeClass();
runnables.add(someClassInstance::someNoArgsVoidMethod);

// will exit the program when executed
runnables.add(() -> System.exit(0));
</div>

<p>We have stored all the <span class="code">Runnable</span> instances above in the <span class="code">runnables</span> list. To execute them, we could iterate the list and invoke the <span class="code">run()</span> method on each element:</p>

<div hljs hljs-no-escape hljs-language="java">
for (Runnable r : runnables) {
    r.run();
}
</div>

<p>Or in a one-liner:</p>

<div hljs hljs-no-escape hljs-language="java">
runnables.forEach(Runnable::run);
</div>

<p>However, this will execute the <span class="code">Runnable</span> instances <em>sequentially</em> and in the same order they were added to the list. What if we wanted to execute them in parallel, or some sequentially and some in parallel? And what if we had more than one list and wanted to execute their <span class="code">Runnable</span> elements interleaved? This is when higher-order functions come in handy.</p>

<div class="separator spacing">&#10022; &#10022; &#10022;</div>

<h3><em>Higher-order functions</em></h3>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function" target="_blank">definition of higher-order function I most like</a> states that <em>&laquo;a higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments and that might return a function as its result&raquo;.</em></p>

<p>While the above definition is quite easy to understand for a programmer that has worked with functional constructs, I think it could be a little bit too much functional for mainstream Java developers. On the other hand, the <span class="code">Runnable</span> interface is widely known in the Java world. So, why not use it to show how useful higher-order functions can be?</p>

<p>We define a <em>higher-order runnable</em> as per the definition given above, except for the term <em>function</em>, which we'll change by <em>runnable</em>. Thus, according to our new, slightly modified definition, a higher-order runnable is <em>&laquo;a function that takes one or more <span class="code">Runnable</span> instances as arguments and that returns a <span class="code">Runnable</span> instance as its result&raquo;.</em></p>

<p>In code, we represent a <span class="code">HigherOrderRunnable</span> with the following interface:</p>

<div hljs hljs-no-escape hljs-language="java">
@FunctionalInterface
public interface HigherOrderRunnable {

    /**
     * Combines the given Runnables into a single Runnable.
     *
     * @param runnables Runnables to be combined
     * @return A Runnable that is the result of combining the given Runnables
     */
    Runnable combine(Runnable... runnables);
}
</div>

<p>The <span class="code">HigherOrderRunnable</span> interface has a <em>single abstract method (SAM)</em> that receives an array of <span class="code">Runnable</span> arguments and returns a <span class="code">Runnable</span> instance as its result. The fact that it has only one abstract method makes it a <em>functional interaface</em>, which means we can implement it by assigning the following lambda expression to it:</p>

<div hljs hljs-no-escape hljs-language="java">
HigherOrderRunnable higherOrderRunnable = (Runnable... runnables) -> {
    Runnable result = new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            for (Runnable r : runnables) {
                r.run();
            }
        }
    };
    return result;
};
</div>

<p>This lambda expression consists of a <span class="code">Runnable</span> varargs parameter (named <span class="code">runnables</span>) and a body in which a new <span class="code">Runnable</span> instance (named <span class="code">result</span>) is created and returned. Within <span class="code">result</span>'s <span class="code">run()</span> method (which is implemented by means of an anonymous inner class), <span class="code">runnables</span> is iterated and the <span class="code">run()</span> method is invoked on each one of its <span class="code">Runnable</span> elements. Simply put, we are returning a <span class="code">Runnable</span> instance that, when executed, will execute the given <span class="code">Runnable</span> instances <em>sequentially</em>.</p>

<p>We have created our first higher-order runnable!</p>

<p>But we can do it better. As <span class="code">Runnable</span> is also a functional interface (its <span class="code">run()</span> method is a <em>single abstract method</em>), we can replace the anonymous inner class with a nested lambda expression:</p>

<div hljs hljs-no-escape hljs-language="java">
HigherOrderRunnable higherOrderRunnable = (Runnable... runnables) -> {
    Runnable result = () -> {
        for (Runnable r : runnables) {
            r.run();
        }
    };
    return result;
};
</div>

<p>While that's better, there's still room for improvement. Instead of the <span class="code">for</span> loop, we could create a <span class="code"><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html" target="_blank">Stream</a></span> from the <span class="code">runnables</span> vargars parameter and execute each one of its <span class="code">Runnable</span> elements with the <span class="code"><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#forEach-java.util.function.Consumer-" target="_blank">forEach()</a></span> terminal operation:</p>

<div hljs hljs-no-escape hljs-language="java">
HigherOrderRunnable higherOrderRunnable = (Runnable... runnables) -> {
    Runnable result = () -> {
        Arrays.stream(runnables).forEach(Runnable::run);
    };
    return result;
};
</div>

<p>If we also inline the <span class="code">result</span> variable, remove the useless braces and let the compiler do its type inference work, we get to the following equivalent, minimal construct:</p>

<div hljs hljs-no-escape hljs-language="java">
HigherOrderRunnable higherOrderRunnable = 
    runnables -> () -> Arrays.stream(runnables).forEach(Runnable::run);
</div>

<p>Starting from Java 8, interfaces are allowed to have <span class="code">static</span> methods. I'll take advantage of this new feature to declare the <span class="code">sequential()</span> factory method on our <span class="code">HigherOrderRunnable</span> functional interface, which will contain the above lambda expression:</p>

<div hljs hljs-no-escape hljs-language="java">
@FunctionalInterface
public interface HigherOrderRunnable {

    Runnable combine(Runnable... runnables);

    static HigherOrderRunnable sequential() {
        return runnables -> () -> Arrays.stream(runnables).forEach(Runnable::run);
    }
}
</div>

<p>If we had three <span class="code">Runnable</span> instances, i.e. <span class="code">r1</span>, <span class="code">r2</span> and <span class="code">r3</span>, we could use our <span class="code">HigherOrderRunnable</span> interface as follows:</p>

<div hljs hljs-no-escape hljs-language="java">
HigherOrderRunnable sequential = HigherOrderRunnable.sequential();

Runnable runnable = sequential.combine(r1, r2, r3);

runnable.run();
</div>

<p>When <span class="code">runnable.run()</span> is invoked, <span class="code">r1</span>, <span class="code">r2</span> and <span class="code">r3</span> will be executed sequentially.</p>

<div class="separator spacing">&#10022; &#10022; &#10022;</div>

<p>Before taking our higher-order runnables to the next level, let's introduce the <span class="code">Sleeper</span> enum, which I'll use in the rest of this newsletter to simulate long-running tasks:</p>

<div hljs hljs-no-escape hljs-language="java">
package com.boundsofjava.newsletter.higherorderrunnable;

import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

/**
 * Enum that simply sleeps; TWO sleeps 2 seconds, THREE sleeps 3 seconds, etc.
 */
public enum Sleeper {
    TWO(2), THREE(3), FOUR(4), FIVE(5), SIX(6), SEVEN(7);

    private final int seconds;

    private Sleeper(int seconds) {
        this.seconds = seconds;
    }

    /**
     * Sleeps the number of seconds specified by this enum's
     * seconds attribute, generating a countdown output.
     */
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.printf("%s => Sleeping for %d seconds...%n", this, seconds);
        // Countdown iteration: n, n - 1, ..., 0
        IntStream.iterate(seconds, i -> i - 1).limit(seconds).forEach(i -> {
            try {
                System.out.printf("%s => %d%n", this, i);
                TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                // Propagate interrupt status
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                System.out.printf("%s => Interrupted!%n", this);
            }
        });
        System.out.printf("%s => 0. Waking up...%n", this);
    }
}
</div>

<p>The <span class="code">Sleeper.sleep()</span> method uses the <span class="code"><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/IntStream.html#iterate-int-java.util.function.IntUnaryOperator-" target="_blank">IntStream.iterate()</a></span> method to generate a stream of descending <span class="code">int</span> elements that are printed in a countdown fashion, i.e. <span class="code">Sleeper.TWO.sleep()</span> produces the <span class="code">2, 1, 0</span> countdown sequence, <span class="code">Sleeper.THREE.sleep()</span> produces <span class="code">3, 2, 1, 0</span>, etc. The <span class="code">Sleeper.sleep()</span> method actually takes <span class="code">n</span> seconds to execute (with <span class="code">n</span> being the starting number) and gently prints the countdown sequence.</p>

<div class="separator spacing">&#10022; &#10022; &#10022;</div>

<p>Let's use the <span class="code">Sleeper</span> enum to see our sequential <span class="code">HigherOrderRunnable</span> in action:</p>

<div hljs hljs-no-escape hljs-language="java">
package com.boundsofjava.newsletter.higherorderrunnable;

public class SequentialHigherOrderRunnableExample {

    public static void demo() {
        // Create a sequential higher-order runnable, that will combine
        // runnables by making them run in sequence
        HigherOrderRunnable sequential = HigherOrderRunnable.sequential();

        // Use the sequential higher-order runnable to combine all our runnables
        // (Note that the result of combining all our runnables is also a
        // runnable)
        Runnable sequence2_7 = sequential.combine(
                Sleeper.TWO::sleep,
                Sleeper.THREE::sleep,
                Sleeper.FOUR::sleep,
                Sleeper.FIVE::sleep,
                Sleeper.SIX::sleep,
                Sleeper.SEVEN::sleep);

        Output.highlighted("SEQUENTIAL");

        // Run our fresh new runnable and see how long it takes
        long init = System.currentTimeMillis();

<p>We're using our <span class="code">HigherOrderRunnable</span> to combine six <span class="code">Runnable</span> instances, which are defined by the <span class="code">Sleeper.TWO::sleep</span>, <span class="code">Sleeper.THREE::sleep</span>, etc method references.
