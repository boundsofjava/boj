<p>Welcome to the third issue of The Bounds of Java Newsletter, written mostly underneath my backyard's pepper tree. Pepper trees are very common in Uruguay. You can almost always find one in a garden, in the countryside or just in public squares. Some old ladies claim their leaves have several healing properties, though I wouldn't dare to confirm it.</p>

<p>My backyard's pepper tree is an inspirational place. The idea of creating a website such as The Bounds of Java was devised in its shade, as well as all newsletters and blog posts up to now. I usually go there to contemplate the branches and leaves swinging in the breeze. At night, it's wonderful to make out the stars beyond the leaves, while digging into some of the most obscure philosophical misteries of the Universe (including the Java programming language).</p>

<p>To some extent, I've always seen programming as a creative process. Nowadays, many companies try to make software development as mechanic as possible, leaving almost no place to research or creativity. The whole software development process adheres to trendy methodologies (or to a mix of them), aiming to standardize the tasks performed by developers. This is not bad per-se, as these methodologies try to reduce risks and detect errors as early as possible (though a methodology that produces good quality software remains yet to be seen). I believe that in a short time more and more tasks will be standardized, and this will make the outcome of each stage of the software development process more predictable. Sooner or later, someone will automate the whole process, meaning the work done by developers today will be replaced by some artificial intelligence. This might sound apocalyptic, but I'm thinking in other industries, i.e. the automotive industry. Cars are not handmade any more, and this is good, because factories are automated and robots do the job better and more quickly than humans. They even allow to build cheaper, better quality cars, while the people who used to manually assemble pieces have been superseded by them. No news here, all I'm saying is that the software industry will not be an exception.</p>

<p>So, will there be room for creative techies in the future? In the automotive industry, the people that still have a job are the experts that make the designs for both the cars and the automatic machines needed to assembly them. And these experts should not only be experts, but also creative, or they will loose their jobs. I claim that it will be the same regarding software: the experts who design software and build the tools to automate the development process will survive. This is why I always favor creativity and knowledge about architecture and design patterns over understanding some methodologies that aim to mechanize the tasks you perform as a developer.</p>
