<p>Welcome to issue #3b of The Bounds of Java Newsletter. This is a follow-up of my <a href="//boundsofjava.com/newsletter/003-introducing-combinators-part1" target="_blank">previous newsletter</a>, in which I introduced the concept of <em>combinator</em>, along with three examples: the <em>Before</em>, <em>After</em> and <em>Around</em> combinators.</p>

<p>Summer is coming to an end in this part of the world... Some people would add 'finally', because they don't like hot weather very much. I'm not one of them, though. It's not that I'm passionate about hot weather, but that I'm very thankful that I've come to exist at a time where the air conditioning system has already been invented. Air conditioning is great, yet non-critical. Our ancestors managed to survive without it for thousands of years, so we could do it as well. Fire, on the other hand, is essential. If we human beings hadn't learned to handle it, we would have been eaten by some ferocious, ancient animals, or we would have perished, frozen to death. There are other discoveries and inventions that, despite not being as critical and essential as fire, are extremely important anyway. For example, consider medicines and vaccines. Mankind managed to survive without them, but at what cost... Current life expectancy would be definitely lower without them.</p>

<p>So, on the one hand, we have great yet non-critical discoveries and inventions, while on the other hand, we have critical, essential ones. Somewhere between these two ends, we also have other discoveries and inventions of extreme importance. Now switch to software-mode. Which one do you think is an essential software invention? Which one is of extreme importance? And which one is dispensable, but feels so great to have it? If you have an answer to any one of these questions, please share it with me by responding to this newsletter, and I'll be happy to use your feedback in my next <a data-ng-href="/blog" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
