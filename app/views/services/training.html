  	<h1>Training</h1>

  	<p>A training consists of tutored lessons with questions, exercises and problems that will help developers improve their skills, with a <strong>strong focus on practice</strong>.</p>

  	<p>The main reason for attending a training is that developers will become quick, fluent and versatile in the technology, framework or technique being trained. Although new theoretical concepts might be introduced, the whole point of a training is to learn by practice.</p>

  	<p>All trainings are structured the same way:
  		<ul>
  			<li>Introduction</li>
  			<li>Warmup</li>
  			<li>Questions, exercises and problems</li>
  			<li>Answers</li>
  			<li>Consolidation</li>
  			<li>Conclusion / Final comments</li>
  		</ul>
  	</p>

	<p>Trainings are targeted for small teams and are conducted either in English or in Spanish, depending on the audience. They are delivered in-house, which allows for discussions that would otherwise be constrained by confidential disclosure agreements.</p>
