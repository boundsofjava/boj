  	<h1>Training</h1>

  	<p>A training consists of lessons with questions, exercises and problems that will help you improve your skills, with a strong <strong>focus on practice</strong>.</p>

  	<p>The main reason for attending a training is that you will become quick, fluent and versatile in the technology, framework or technique being trained. You will also be introduced to new theoretical concepts, though the whole point of a training is to learn by practice.</p>

  	<p>All trainings are structured the same way:
  		<ul>
  			<li>Introduction</li>
  			<li>Warmup</li>
  			<li>Questions, exercises and problems</li>
  			<li>Answers</li>
  			<li>Consolidation</li>
  			<li>Final comments</li>
  		</ul>
  	</p>
